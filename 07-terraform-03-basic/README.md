# Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

## Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

Если в рамках предыдущего задания у вас уже есть аккаунт AWS, то давайте продолжим знакомство со взаимодействием
терраформа и aws. 

1. Создайте s3 бакет, iam роль и пользователя от которого будет работать терраформ. Можно создать отдельного пользователя,
а можно использовать созданного в рамках предыдущего задания, просто добавьте ему необходимы права, как описано 
[здесь](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html).
1. Зарегистрируйте бэкэнд в терраформ проекте как описано по ссылке выше. 


## Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы. 

1. Выполните `terraform init`:
    * если был создан бэкэнд в S3, то терраформ создат файл стейтов в S3 и запись в таблице 
dynamodb.
    * иначе будет создан локальный файл со стейтами.  
1. Создайте два воркспейса `stage` и `prod`.
1. В уже созданный `aws_instance` добавьте зависимость типа инстанса от вокспейса, что бы в разных ворскспейсах 
использовались разные `instance_type`.
1. Добавим `count`. Для `stage` должен создаться один экземпляр `ec2`, а для `prod` два. 
1. Создайте рядом еще один `aws_instance`, но теперь определите их количество при помощи `for_each`, а не `count`.
1. Что бы при изменении типа инстанса не возникло ситуации, когда не будет ни одного инстанса добавьте параметр
жизненного цикла `create_before_destroy = true` в один из рессурсов `aws_instance`.
1. При желании поэкспериментируйте с другими параметрами и рессурсами.

В виде результата работы пришлите:
* Вывод команды `terraform workspace list`.
* Вывод команды `terraform plan` для воркспейса `prod`.

### **Ответ**

#### **Задача 1**

1. Создание s3 backet 
   
s3.tf
```tf
provider "aws" {
  profile = "terraform"
  shared_credentials_file = "/home/rkhozyainov/.aws/credentials"
  region  = "us-west-1"
}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "rkh-terraform-state"
  force_destroy = true
  versioning {
          enabled = true
      }
}
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
    name = "rkh-terraform-state-locks"
    billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
    hash_key = "LockID"
    
    attribute {
        name = "LockID"
        type = "S"
    }
}
```

```bash
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.74.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.74.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03$ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03$ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks will be created
  + resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
      + arn              = (known after apply)
      + billing_mode     = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
      + hash_key         = "LockID"
      + id               = (known after apply)
      + name             = "rkh-terraform-state-locks"
      + read_capacity    = (known after apply)
      + stream_arn       = (known after apply)
      + stream_label     = (known after apply)
      + stream_view_type = (known after apply)
      + tags_all         = (known after apply)
      + write_capacity   = (known after apply)

      + attribute {
          + name = "LockID"
          + type = "S"
        }

      + point_in_time_recovery {
          + enabled = (known after apply)
        }


      + server_side_encryption {
          + enabled     = (known after apply)
          + kms_key_arn = (known after apply)
        }

      + ttl {
          + attribute_name = (known after apply)
          + enabled        = (known after apply)
        }
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
      + acceleration_status         = (known after apply)
      + acl                         = "private"
      + arn                         = (known after apply)
      + bucket                      = "rkh-terraform-state"
      + bucket_domain_name          = (known after apply)
      + bucket_regional_domain_name = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy               = true
      + hosted_zone_id              = (known after apply)
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + region                      = (known after apply)
      + request_payer               = (known after apply)
      + tags_all                    = (known after apply)
      + website_domain              = (known after apply)
      + website_endpoint            = (known after apply)

      + versioning {
          + enabled    = true
          + mfa_delete = false
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state: Creating...
aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks: Creation complete after 12s [id=rkh-terraform-state-locks]
aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state: Creation complete after 16s [id=rkh-terraform-state]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
2. Создание бэкэнда в терраформ, заменяем файл s3.tf

s3.tf
```terraform
provider "aws" {
    profile = "terraform"
    shared_credentials_file = "/home/rkhozyainov/.aws/credentials"
    region  = "us-west-1"
}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
    bucket = "rkh-terraform-state"
    force_destroy = true
    versioning {
          enabled = true
      }
}
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
    name = "rkh-terraform-state-locks"
    billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
    hash_key = "LockID"
    
    attribute {
        name = "LockID"
        type = "S"
    }
}
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
    bucket = "rkh-terraform-state"
    key = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-1"
    dynamodb_table = "rkh-terraform-state-locks"
    encrypt = true
    profile = "terraform"
  }
}
```

#### **Задача 2**

1. terraform init в s3

```bash
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes

Releasing state lock. This may take a few moments...

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v3.74.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
2. Создание Workspace
```bash
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03/test$ terraform workspace new stage
Created and switched to workspace "stage"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03/test$ terraform workspace new prod
Created and switched to workspace "prod"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03/test$ terraform init

  stage
```
3. Добавление count, + 1 aws_instance c for_each, добавление параметра жизненного цикла create_before_destroy = true 

main.tf
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "rkh-terraform-state"
    key = "rkh-workspacec/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-1"
    dynamodb_table = "rkh-terraform-state-locks"
    encrypt = true
    profile = "terraform"
  }
}
provider "aws" {
  profile = "terraform"
  shared_credentials_file = "/home/rkhozyainov/.aws/credentials"
  region  = "us-west-1"
}
data "aws_ami" "last-ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
    }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
    }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

locals {
      instance_type = {
          stage = "t2.micro"
          prod = "t2.micro"
      }
      instance_count = {
        stage = 1
        prod = 2
      }
      instances = {
          "t2.micro" = data.aws_ami.last-ubuntu.id
          "t2.micro" = data.aws_ami.last-ubuntu.id
      }
    }
resource "aws_instance" "test" {
    ami           = data.aws_ami.last-ubuntu.id
    instance_type = local.instance_type[terraform.workspace]
    count = local.instance_count[terraform.workspace]
    tags = {
    Name = "test-ubuntu"
  }
}
resource "aws_instance" "test2" {
    for_each = local.instances

    ami           = each.value
    instance_type = each.key

    lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
    }
}
data "aws_caller_identity" "test_call_id" {}
data "aws_region" "test_reg" {}
```

4. Вывод terraform plan для prod

```
rkhozyainov@rkhozyainov-T530-ubuntu:~/terraform/07-03/test$ terraform plan
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.test[0] will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "test" {
